            Bhagat Singh (27 September 1907[1] 23 March 1931) was a charismatic Indian revolutionary[3] 
             who participated in the mistaken murder of a junior British police officer[4] in what was to 
             be retaliation for thedeath of an Indian nationalist.[5] He later took part in a largely symbolic 
             bombing of the CentralLegislative Assembly in Delhi and a hunger strike in jail, which—on the back 
             of sympathetic coverage in Indian-owned newspapers—turned him into a household name in the Punjab 
             region, and after his execution at age 23 into a martyr and folk hero in Northern India.[6] Borrowing 
             ideas from Bolshevism and anarchism,[7] he electrified a growing militancy in India in the 1930s, 
             and prompted urgent introspection within the Indian National Congress's nonviolent but eventually
              successful campaign for India's independence
